      In the case of the noise-free dataset, overfitting cannot occur because there is a 
      deterministic relationship between the x-values and their corresponding
      y-values, defined by the function. Additionally, the model cannot learn misleading patterns 
      that might arise from noise. The loss values for both the training and test data are very small 
      and similar, indicating good generalizability. 
      <p></p>
      Smaller datasets lead to overfitting more quickly, 
      resulting in a higher discrepancy between the loss values, with a lower training loss and a 
      higher test loss. Otherwise, it was challenging to cause the model to overfit solely through 
      the number of epochs. Generally, more epochs led to better results for 
      the best-fit model. However, if the number of epochs became too large, the model eventually 
      memorized the training data and its noise, resulting in poorer generalization to the test data.
      <p></p>
      Increasing the noise variance also led to a clearly 
      observable overfitting situation. The model was misled by the strong fluctuations and 
      inaccurately represented the untrained data.

       Chart.js: I utilized the Chart.js library to generate diagrams, 
       which comes with various built-in features like tooltips and labels. 
       For the visualization scatter plots were used, some showing multiple datasets (train & test).

          Generate Data

  </p>
  <p>
    The function, `generateData`, creates the dataset for the task. 
    It generates a specified number of data points (`numDataPoints`) where the x-values 
    are random numbers within a defined range (`xMin`, `xMax`). The corresponding y-values 
    are calculated using the given y-function. The data is then split into training 
    and testing sets (`trainData` and `testData`) using a random shuffle. Then
    noise is added to clones of both sets (`trainDataNoisy` and `testDataNoisy`) based on a provided 
    variance (`noiseVariance`). The return value consists of the 4 datasets, the train- and test-data 
    without noise, and the train- and test-data with noise.

  After the datasets have been generated, the actual training process for machine learning models begins. 
  First, a model is created based on the parameters defined in the task. 
  This model is then trained using the generated datasets. 
  The training process involves multiple epochs and batch sizes, which control the number of 
  passes through the dataset and the number of data points per pass. Once training is complete, 
  predictions can be made for new data points. These predictions are passed along with the original 
  x-values to a visualization function that displays the results graphically. 
  In addition, a "predict" method is used to calculate the loss values. 
  Then the models for best fit and overfit are created and visualised just like for the first model.
