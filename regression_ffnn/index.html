      In the case of the noise-free dataset, overfitting cannot occur because there is a 
      deterministic relationship between the x-values and their corresponding
      y-values, defined by the function. Additionally, the model cannot learn misleading patterns 
      that might arise from noise. The loss values for both the training and test data are very small 
      and similar, indicating good generalizability. Smaller datasets lead to overfitting more quickly, 
      resulting in a higher discrepancy between the loss values, with a lower training loss and a 
      higher test loss. Otherwise, it was challenging to cause the model to overfit solely through 
      the number of epochs. Generally, more epochs led to better results for 
      the best-fit model. However, if the number of epochs became too large, the model eventually 
      memorized the training data and its noise, resulting in poorer generalization to the test data.
      Increasing the noise variance also led to a clearly 
      observable overfitting situation. The model was misled by the strong fluctuations and 
      inaccurately represented the untrained data.

       Chart.js: I utilized the Chart.js library to generate diagrams, 
       which comes with various built-in features like tooltips and labels. 
       For the visualization scatter plots were used, some showing multiple datasets (train & test).
